## About Me

I am a Masterâ€™s student in User Experience Design at the University of Toronto and hold a degree in Interactive Media Arts from New York University. My academic journey has been marked by a deep commitment to understanding and improving user experiences. I have honed my skills through hands-on experiences at Tesla and Makari de Suisse in New York, where I focused on user-centric design and digital content creation. I am proficient in a range of design and development tools and adept at translating user data into meaningful design insights. My ability to work both collaboratively and independently, coupled with strong communication skills, makes me an ideal candidate for roles requiring innovative UX research and design solutions.
